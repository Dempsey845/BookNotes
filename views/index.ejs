          <p>
            Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in
            any situation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read
            classic from 1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren’t
            enough because the little book is filled with so many memorable
            stories — examples of great day-to-day moments of negotiation that
            will stick in your head for when you need them. (I especially loved
            the one about the power of the prisoner in solitary confinement.) So
            go buy and read the book. I’m giving it a 10/10 rating even though
            the second half of the book loses steam, because the first half is
            so crucial.
